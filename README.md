train an ML model on a real-world dataset following these steps:

Pick a large real-world dataset from Kaggle and download it using opendatasets. Your training set should contain at least 50,000 rows and 5 columns of data.

Read the dataset description, understand the problem statement and describe the modeling objective clearly. You can also browse through existing notebooks created by others for inspiration.

Perform exploratory data analysis, gather insights about the data, perform feature engineering, create a training-validation split, and prepare the data for modeling.

Train & evaluate different machine learning models, tune hyperparameters and reduce overfitting to improve the model.

Report the final performance of your best model(s), show sample predictions, and save model weights. Summarize your work, share links to references, and suggest ideas for future work.
